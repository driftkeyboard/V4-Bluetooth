# Drift Keyboard V4 — Trackball Edition, BLE Enabled  
by **Timception**

Welcome to the **Drift Keyboard V4 — Trackball Edition**.  
This version keeps the familiar shape of previous Drift models while introducing some interesting additional features:

---

## 🆕 Key Features

- ZMK Studio enabled, and can also be keymapped using [Nick Coutsos' Editor](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor)  
- Adds a **newly integrated trackball** for smoother control  
- Can install sockets for **choc v1/v2 switches**

---

## 🔢 Key Count & Layout

- **63 keys** total  
- Only **5 keys fewer** than Drift V2/V3 (Originally 68 keys)  
- Removed the **outermost columns**, but the layout still provides everything needed to easily migrate from conventioal 60%-65% keyboards.  
- The **encoder** is now placed on the **thumb cluster**  
- The **right half** features a **swappable trackball**, allowing you to try different materials or textures.

If you’ve used the Drift V2 or V3 before, you’ll adapt to this version very quickly.  
The trackball has been smoothly integrated and is not hard to get used to.

## ⚙️ Build Options

The V4 supports multiple build configurations:

- **MX switch** builds  
- **Choc V1/V2 low-profile** builds  
- Many possibilities for **multiple case designs**, I made many parts for this, and hope to keep making more!

### 🎯 Mouse Controls (When Mouse Mode Is Active)

| Action | Key |
|--------|------|
| **Left Click** | `K` |
| **Right Click** | `L` |
| **Scroll** | Hold `O` + move the trackball |


### ⚙️ Customizing Trackball Behavior
If you want to customize how the trackball or mouse keys work, you’ll need to update your firmware:

- Edit your fork on GitHub  
- Recompile the firmware  
- Flash **all 2 devices**: left half, right half
